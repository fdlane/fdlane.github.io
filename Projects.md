## VBSmgr MS Access

This is a pet project originally written as a MS Access application in 2003 for my local church to manage their Vacation Bible School. The Church has a GIANT VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL event each year and needed a way to track the Children, Workers, Buses, Classes, and Neighborhoods.

Features
- Track attendance for children and workers
- Bus roster report
- Class roster report
- Manage Bus capacities
- Manage Classroom capacities
- Manage Bus routes by neighborhood
- Track Special Needs such as food allergies
- Print Child badges, color coded by age range
- VBS Manager :: MS Access
- The VBS Manager MS Access version is free and can be used to manage your Vacation Bible School Event.

[Getting Started with VbsMgr MS Access](/projects/vbsmgr-ms-access/)

### VBS Manager :: Web App
The VBS Manager Web App version is deployed only as a demo and prototype. Some user testing has been done, but the application has not been used to manage an event.  If the application would be helpful to your church, please contact me about deploying a copy for you.

The source code of this version is available on GitHub.  If you are the tech savvy kind, feel free to fork the project and deploy.

### VBS Manager :: Next

This new version is also a web application currently under development.
