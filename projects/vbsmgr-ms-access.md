title: VBSmgr MS Access

## Overview

This version of the VBS Manager solution is a MS Access application that consists of two database files. A User Interface database and Backend database where the data is stored.

The User Interface or Front End of the application is named VbsMgr.mdb. This is the file that users will open. All users can open the same database file or a copy can be saved on each users’ machine.

Your data is stored in a file named VbsMgr_BE.mdb. The “_BE” portion of the file name is used to indicate the ‘Backend’ of the application. This is where all your data is stored and SHOULD be routinely backed up.
