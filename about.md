<img class="ui small left floated image"  alt="F. DeWayne Lane" src="/images/profile-sm.jpg">

I am first a Christian doing his best to follow Jesus Christ; the husband to Staci, and the father of four.  

I am a developer currently working for [Knoxville Utilities Board](https://www.kub.org) creating custom web applications and integrations for both internal and external customers. We specialize in technologies like Oracle, SQL Server, Java, MQ Series, and ElasticSearch on the Server-side and lots of JavaScript on the client-side.  I enjoy creating web applications using EmberJs and the ESRI JavaScript API.

As fun as developing can be, I really enjoy being on the lake with my family and friends.
