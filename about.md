![F. DeWayne Lane](/images/profile-sm.jpg){: .ui .small .left .floated .image }

I am, first and foremost, a Christian striving to follow Jesus Christ. I am the husband of Staci, the father of four, and an active instrument-rated pilot.

I am a developer currently working for [Knoxville Utilities Board](https://www.kub.org){:target="_blank"}, where I create custom web applications and integrations for both internal and external customers. We specialize in technologies such as Kubernetes, Oracle, SQL Server, Java, MQ Series, and ElasticSearch on the server-side, and extensive use of JavaScript on the client-side. I enjoy developing web applications using EmberJs and the ESRI JavaScript API.

As much as I enjoy developing, I also love spending time on the lake or in the sky with my family and friends.
